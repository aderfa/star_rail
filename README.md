for 
hook::init(void) bugs you can add minhook first then recompile, if you already add but doesn't work try readd and reopen vscode

this is how to add mihook library

there are 2 minhooks you can put them in the ImGui DirectX 11 Kiero Hook and kiero default minhook folders in ImGui DirectX 11 Kiero Hook\kiero\minhook\include

if u meet EasyPeasy error you can remove it from Refrences then recompile
it's an injector but I didn't include the source here because there will be even more errors if you can't understand what error is that
